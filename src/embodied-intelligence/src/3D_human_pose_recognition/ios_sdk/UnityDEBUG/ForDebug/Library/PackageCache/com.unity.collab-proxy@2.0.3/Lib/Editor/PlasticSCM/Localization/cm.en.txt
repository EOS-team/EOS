WARNING: the certificate of this host doesn't match the one you have in the key 
store. It may mean that the identity of the server has been compromised or a 
man-in-the-middle attack is being performed on you.

Certificate details:
- Issued to: {0}
- Issued by: {1}
- Expiration date: {3}
- Certificate hash: {5}

If you were expecting this change and trust the new certificate, choose 'Yes' 
  to add the key to the Unity VCS key store and trust this certificate in the 
  future.
If you want to carry on connecting just once, without adding the key to the 
  store, choose 'No'.
If you want to abandon this connection, choose 'Cancel'. This is the ONLY
  guaranteed safe choice.
