    following key to your 'client.conf' file:

        <MergeWithPendingChanges>yes</MergeWithPendingChanges>

== EncryptionConfigurationExplanation ==
The '{0}' source server requires data encryption.
Your server (aka '{1}') is not yet configured to handle encrypted data from it.

Remarks:
* Be very careful with the encryption password; it's the only way to decrypt your data on '{0}'.
* If you're decrypting data and you enter a wrong password, the data will fail to decrypt and you will have to edit cryptedservers.conf on your server to fix it.
* Be careful to use the same password (encryption key) company-wide to work with '{0}'. Otherwise, data will be encrypted differently in each server.

Enter a password to generate the encryption key (leave empty to cancel):

== EncryptionPasswordNotEntered ==
You didn't entered a password. Encryption won't be configured for server '{0}'.

== EncryptionConfigurationFailed ==
Failed to configure encryption for server '{0}'.

== EncryptionConfigurationSucceeded ==
Encryption configuration added for server '{0}'.
