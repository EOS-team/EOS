                  resultFile:        {{-r | --result}}=<filename>

      -a | --automatic:        Automatically merge without user interaction unless conflicts are found.

      --silent:                This option must be used combined with the --automatic option.
                               When a merge can't be solved automatically, this option causes the tool to return immediately
                               with a non-zero exit code (no semanticmerge tool is shown).
                               If the tool was able to solve the merge automatically, the program returns exit code 0.

      --merge-decl:            Merge automatically as many declarations* as possible.

      --process-all-merges:    Merge automatically as many declarations* as possible and
                               run the external text based tool for each non-automatic merge declaration.

        *A declaration is the statement that defines any of the supported syntax elements: classes, methods, attributes, etc.
         Depending on the element type (e.g. classes, methods), they include a body where the element is implemented.

      --include-format-change: Include changes where only indentation and EOLs have been modified.
                               This includes differences in white spaces and tabs at the beginning of lines and
                               differences in EOLs. It also includes white lines at the beginning of declarations.
                               By default all these differences are ignored to simplify the merge/diff.

      --log-external-parser:   Enable logging the file contents to debug external parsers.

Semantic is a different kind of merge tool. It parses the code before calculating the merge, which makes it possible to detect and automatically solve most conflicts.

It is different than most merge tools you have used so far, so it is worth investing a few minutes browsing the sample cases to become a real merge master and get the best out of the tool.
