//! Build-time error.
//!
//! This crate provides a function `build_error`, which will panic in
//! compile-time if executed in const context, and will cause a build error
//! if not executed at compile time and the optimizer does not optimise away the
//! call.
//!
//! It is used by `build_assert!` in the kernel crate, allowing checking of
//! conditions that could be checked statically, but could not be enforced in
//! Rust yet (e.g. perform some checks in const functions, but those
//! functions could still be called in the runtime).

    // yet be used in const context.
