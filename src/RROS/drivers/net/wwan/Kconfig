	help
	  MHI WWAN CTRL allows QCOM-based PCIe modems to expose different modem
	  control protocols/ports to userspace, including AT, MBIM, QMI, DIAG
	  and FIREHOSE. These protocols can be accessed directly from userspace
	  (e.g. AT commands) or via libraries/tools (e.g. libmbim, libqmi,
	  libqcdm...).

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called mhi_wwan_ctrl.
