/* Pi3 uses a GPIO expander to drive the LEDs which can only be accessed
   from the VPU. There is a special driver for this with a separate DT node,
   which has the unfortunate consequence of breaking the act_led_gpio and
   act_led_activelow dtparams.

   This overlay changes the GPIO controller back to the standard one and
   restores the dtparams.
