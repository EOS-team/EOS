Sensor Ancillary Metadata

Description
===========

This format describes ancillary data generated by a camera sensor and
transmitted over a stream on the camera bus. Sensor vendors generally have their
own custom format for this ancillary data. Some vendors follow a generic
CSI-2/SMIA embedded data format as described in the `CSI-2 specification.
<https://mipi.org/specifications/csi-2>`_

The size of the embedded buffer is defined as a single line with a pixel width
width specified in bytes. This is obtained by a call to the
:c:type:`VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_FMT` ioctl on the sensor subdevice where the ``pad``
field in :c:type:`v4l2_subdev_format` is set to 1.  Note that this size is fixed
and cannot be modified with a call to :c:type:`VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT`.
