* Broadcom BCM2835 SMI driver.

SMI or secondary memory interface is a peripheral specific to certain Broadcom
SOCs, and is helpful for talking to things like parallel-interface displays
and NAND flashes (in fact, most things with a parallel register interface).

Required properties:
- compatible: "brcm,bcm2835-smi"
- reg: Should contain location and length of SMI registers and SMI clkman regs
- interrupts: *the* SMI interrupt.
- pinctrl-names: should be "default".
- pinctrl-0: the phandle of the gpio pin node.
- brcm,smi-clock-source: the clock source for clkman
- brcm,smi-clock-divisor: the integer clock divisor for clkman
- dmas: the dma controller phandle and the DREQ number (4 on a 2835)
- dma-names: the name used by the driver to request its channel.
  Should be "rx-tx".

Optional properties:
- None.

Examples:

8 data pin configuration:

smi: smi@7e600000 {
	compatible = "brcm,bcm2835-smi";
	reg = <0x7e600000 0x44>, <0x7e1010b0 0x8>;
	interrupts = <2 16>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&smi_pins>;
	brcm,smi-clock-source = <6>;
	brcm,smi-clock-divisor = <4>;
	dmas = <&dma 4>;
	dma-names = "rx-tx";

	status = "okay";
};

smi_pins: smi_pins {
	brcm,pins = <2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15>;
	/* Alt 1: SMI */
	brcm,function = <5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5>;
	/* /CS, /WE and /OE are pulled high, as they are
	   generally active low signals */
	brcm,pull = <2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>;
};
