* Broadcom BCM2835 SMI character device driver.

SMI or secondary memory interface is a peripheral specific to certain Broadcom
SOCs, and is helpful for talking to things like parallel-interface displays
and NAND flashes (in fact, most things with a parallel register interface).

This driver adds a character device which provides a user-space interface to
an instance of the SMI driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: "brcm,bcm2835-smi-dev"
- smi_handle: a phandle to the smi node.

Optional properties:
- None.
